welcome to my booyermore tutorial if you are here then you did not understand due to the low time frame of the video (Fear not!) for all the resources are here :D
https://dwnusbaum.github.io/boyer-moore-demo/ refer to this for live trials of the algorithm
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kUdowLCNWzE refeer to this for another tutorial of the algorithm
https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/boyer-moore-algorithm-good-suffix-heuristic/
https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/boyer-moore-algorithm-for-pattern-searching/
and for even more refrence please refer to the main book of Analysis and design of algorithm edition 3 on the space for time area (it even has more sophisticated algorithms regarding space for time)
(most of all enjoy the proccess of learning!)
